The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a Fixed Asset Management application. Initially, the user requested a Java/Spring Boot backend with MySQL and a React/Vite frontend. However, due to platform limitations, the AI guided the user to pivot to a FastAPI/MongoDB backend and React frontend. Further, the scope was narrowed to frontend-only development for the initial phase. The AI then focused on building the Dashboard and Asset Master pages. A significant phase involved refactoring the frontend to a clean architecture using React Router v6, Redux Toolkit, and various optimizations following user-provided guidelines, including dependency cleanup and Vite migration. The AI demonstrated an iterative debugging process, fixing a critical Asset Master loading bug by implementing mock data fallback. The latest work involves pulling updates from a GitHub  branch, integrating a new logo and improved styling, and then debugging a Blocked request (CORS) error after the extensive frontend restructuring, which is the current immediate task.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a production-ready Fixed Asset Management application. Key requirements include:
-   **Backend:** Initially Java 8, Spring Boot 2.7.x, Maven, Spring Web, Security (JWT), Data JPA, Flyway, MySQL 8, MapStruct, Lombok, OpenAPI 3. *This was later transitioned to FastAPI (Python) + MongoDB due to platform support, then effectively deferred as user requested frontend only.*
-   **Frontend:** React 18.3.1 (Vite), React Router v6+, TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod, Tailwind CSS with design tokens, shadcn/ui, Axios. *Later updated to React 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.2, TailwindCSS 4.1.13, Redux Toolkit, Framer Motion, React Icons.*
-   **Auth & Roles:** JWT with ADMIN, ASSET_MANAGER, AUDITOR, STAFF roles; RBAC guards.
-   **Entities:** Asset, Category, Location, Vendor, Assignment, MaintenanceTicket, DepreciationLedger, Document, User, AuditLog (UUID IDs, audit fields, soft delete for Document, unique AssetTag, depreciation fields: SLM/WDV method, usefulLifeMonths, salvageValue).
-   **API:** Base , CRUD, pagination, sorting, filtering, standardized error responses, OpenAPI docs. Endpoints for auth, assets (CRUD, bulk import/export CSV/XLSX, image upload, history, retire), categories/locations/vendors (CRUD), assignments, maintenance, documents, depreciation, reports.
-   **Business Rules:** Cannot delete assigned asset, unique AssetTag, specific depreciation formulas (SLM, WDV), monthly depreciation scheduler.
-   **Frontend Screens:** Login, Dashboard (KPIs & charts), Assets List with filters, Asset Detail (tabs), Create/Edit Asset (multi-step), Bulk Import Wizard, Maintenance Kanban, Reports, Settings. Must match Adobe XD design exactly (typography, spacing, color tokens to CSS variables). Responsive layout, dark mode, a11y, error boundaries, skeletons, toasts.
-   **DevOps & Quality:** Dockerize (backend/frontend), docker-compose (Postgres + services), .env/.env.example, tests (JUnit5, Mockito, Testcontainers for backend; Vitest/RTL, Playwright for frontend), Linters/formatters, Postman/OpenAPI JSON.
-   **Deliverables:** Two repos (backend, frontend), , seed migrations, README.
-   **Initial Scope:** User initially requested first page only focusing on the dashboard, then expanded to Asset Master page, and later a full frontend restructuring.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React (19.1.1), React Router (v6.30.1), Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist, Tailwind CSS (3.4.17), Shadcn UI, Vite (7.1.2), Axios, Framer Motion, React Icons, Zod, React Hook Form, ESLint, Prettier.
-   **Backend (planned but not implemented by AI):** FastAPI, MongoDB.
-   **Development Practices:** Git, Docker, Supervisor, environment variables, UUIDs for IDs, ISO strings for DateTime serialization.

<code_architecture>
The application features a  React application, with a  directory provided as a template but not implemented by the AI.



**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   ****: Manages frontend dependencies. It was heavily modified to streamline dependencies for Vite, remove unnecessary libraries, and update versions to match user's latest requirements (React 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.2, TailwindCSS 4.1.13, etc.).
-   ****: Replaced the original Create React App setup. Configured for React, Tailwind CSS, path aliases (), and bundle optimizations. Currently, it's being updated to include  to resolve a Blocked request error.
-   ** & **: Tailwind CSS configuration and global styles. Updated to adhere to standard v3 Tailwind practices, utilizing  directives for base, components, and utilities.
-   ****: The main application component. It's responsible for setting up React Router routes (which are lazy-loaded), Redux Provider, and ErrorBoundary. It was recently simplified as part of debugging the application not working issue.
-   ****: The entry point for the React application, rendering the root component and wrapping it with Redux Provider and PersistGate.
-   ****: A newly integrated SVG logo file, providing professional branding to the application.
-   ****: The main navigation component, now featuring the integrated logo, expanded menu structure, and updated dark theme styling (, ).
-   ****: Implements the initial dashboard screen with placeholder KPIs and charts, showcasing enterprise dashboard patterns.
-   ****: Displays asset data in a tabular format with search, filter, pagination, and action buttons. Initially had a loading issue due to a missing backend API, which was resolved by implementing mock data and robust loading state management.
-   ****: A Redux slice managing the state of assets. It includes mock asset data and an asynchronous thunk () that now gracefully falls back to mock data if the API is unavailable, resolving the loading issue.
-   ****: A placeholder file for Axios configurations and API calls, using interceptors for centralized request/response handling.
-   ****: Configures the Redux store using  and  for state management and persistence across sessions.
-   ****: Contains various custom hooks (, , , etc.) for abstracting common UI logic and optimizing performance.
-   ****: Houses utility functions ( for common operations,  for form rules,  for Tailwind class merging).
-   ****: A centralized configuration file for exporting images, facilitating better asset management.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete backend implementation using FastAPI and MongoDB to replace mock data.
-   Implement remaining frontend pages and features as per the detailed product requirements (e.g., Login, Asset Detail, Bulk Import, Maintenance Kanban, Reports, Settings, User/Role management).
-   Address the Minor debugging needed for Add Asset modal noted during GitHub update verification (though later self-reported as fixed).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging a critical issue where the application was not working. Specifically, the frontend was encountering a Blocked request error, indicating that the Vite development server was preventing access from the preview domain (). This is a configuration issue related to Vite's  setting. As part of the debugging process, the AI had temporarily simplified  and  to isolate the problem. The current state reflects a highly optimized and restructured frontend codebase, but it is currently non-functional due to this network-related configuration error. The AI had also previously attempted to fix a lingering  plugin reference in , which was causing other compilation issues.

Perfect! I can see the exact issue now. The Vite server is blocking the request from the preview domain. Let me fix this by adding the allowed host to the vite.config.js:
